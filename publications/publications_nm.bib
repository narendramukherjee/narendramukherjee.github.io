  abstract={Adult emergence (eclosion) of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster under constant laboratory conditions follows a circadian pattern with bouts of eclosion recurring at approximately 24 h intervals. Under periodic light:dark (LD) cycles, adults emerge only during a specific time of the day followed by little or no emergence for the rest of the day. This phenomenon is therefore equated to a gate of emergence that, when open, allows adults to emerge and when closed, no emergence takes place. In this study, we attempt to understand the mechanism underlying adult emergence rhythm in D. melanogaster using a model based on interplay between developmental and circadian clock systems. The model is composed of an oscillatory threshold of a substance that builds up during pre-adult development. Computer simulations based on this model enabled us to make specific predictions about the ‘gate width’ of the adult emergence rhythm under conditions of fast/slow pre-adult development and short/long circadian periods, which we subsequently tested empirically. The main predictions from the simulations are: (1) flies with faster development have greater gate width and vice versa, and (2) flies with faster circadian clocks have shorter gate width and vice versa. To empirically validate these predictions, we carried out experiments on D. melanogaster populations known to have fast/slow pre-adult development, short/long circadian periods and narrow/wide gate width. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of pre-adult development of the above flies by increasing/decreasing ambient temperature to further examine the influence of developmental rates on gate width of adult emergence rhythm by a complementary approach. The results show that gate width is greatly influenced by the duration of pre-adult development and the length of circadian cycles. This suggests that the adult emergence rhythm of D. melanogaster may be based on mechanisms involving oscillatory threshold and build-up of a developmental substance.}

  abstract={Behaviors involving repeated investments on the part of the actor and diminishing marginal returns from these investments are seen to be optimized by maximizing the rate of returns from the behavior. This idea, known as the marginal value theorem, was initially used to study foraging strategies in animals when food is available in patches in an environment. In this study, we adopt the marginal value theorem and utilize it to study courtship behavior in zebrafish Danio rerio (with males being equivalent to foraging animals and females being compared to patches of resources). Our application of the marginal value theorem to courtship in zebrafish predicted that a male spends less time courting a female if the female density in the environment is high and vice-versa. The results of our experiments support these predictions and show that courtship time in zebrafish is indeed greatly influenced by the female density in the environment. Additionally, we went on to construct a return function in the form of the probability that a female being courted mates with the male courting her as a function of the time invested by the male in courtship (equivalently, the number of times the male physically interacts with the female). This return function, in a sense, gives an idea of the sexual response of a female as the investment in courtship from the side of a male increases and can potentially prove the existence of diminishing marginal returns from repeated investments in courtship on the part of the male.}

  abstract={Robustness is a fundamental property of biological timing systems that is likely to ensure their efficient functioning under a wide range of environmental conditions. Here we report the findings of our study aimed at examining robustness of circadian clocks in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster populations selected to emerge as adults within a narrow window of time. Previously, we have reported that such flies display enhanced synchrony, accuracy, and precision in their adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms. Since it is expected that accurate and precise circadian clocks may confer enhanced stability in circadian time-keeping, we decided to examine robustness in circadian rhythms of flies from the selected populations by subjecting them to a variety of environmental conditions comprising of a range of photoperiods, light intensities, ambient temperatures, and constant darkness. The results revealed that adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms of flies from the selected stocks were more robust than controls, as they displayed enhanced stability under a wide variety of environmental conditions. These results suggest that selection for adult emergence within a narrow window of time results in the evolution of robustness in circadian timing systems of the fruit fly D. melanogaster.}

  abstract={Amplitude modulation in limit cycle models of circadian clocks has been previously formulated to explain the phenomenon of temperature compensation. These models propose that invariance of clock period (τ) with changing temperature is a result of the system traversing small or large limit cycles such that despite a decrease or an increase in the linear velocity of the clock owing to slowing down or speeding up of the underlying biochemical reactions, respectively, the angular velocity and, thus, the clock period remain constant. In addition, these models predict that phase resetting behavior of circadian clocks described by limit cycles of different amplitudes at low or high temperatures will be drastically different. More specifically, this class of models predicts that at low temperatures, circadian clocks will respond to perturbations by eliciting larger phase shifts by virtue of their smaller amplitude and vice versa. Here, we present the results of our tests of this prediction: We examined the nature of photic phase response curves (PRCs) and phase transition curves (PTCs) for the circadian clocks of 4 wild-type fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster populations at 3 different ambient temperatures (18, 25, and 29 °C). Interestingly, we observed that at the low temperature of 18 °C, fly clocks respond to light perturbations more strongly, eliciting strong (type 0) PRCs and PTCs, while at moderate (25 °C) and high (29 °C) temperatures the same stimuli evoke weak (type 1) responses. This pattern of strong and weak phase resetting at low and high temperatures, respectively, renders support for the limit cycle amplitude modulation model for temperature compensation of circadian clocks.}

  abstract={Whereas many laboratory-studied decisions involve a highly trained animal identifying an ambiguous stimulus, many naturalistic decisions do not. Consumption decisions, for instance, involve determining whether to eject or consume an already identified stimulus in the mouth and are decisions that can be made without training. By standard analyses, rodent cortical single-neuron taste responses come to predict such consumption decisions across the 500 ms preceding the consumption or rejection itself; decision-related firing emerges well after stimulus identification. Analyzing single-trial ensemble activity using hidden Markov models, we show these decision-related cortical responses to be part of a reliable sequence of states (each defined by the firing rates within the ensemble) separated by brief state-to-state transitions, the latencies of which vary widely between trials. When we aligned data to the onset of the (late-appearing) state that dominates during the time period in which single-neuron firing is correlated to taste palatability, the apparent ramp in stimulus-aligned choice-related firing was shown to be a much more precipitous coherent jump. This jump in choice-related firing resembled a step function more than it did the output of a standard (ramping) decision-making model, and provided a robust prediction of decision latency in single trials. Together, these results demonstrate that activity related to naturalistic consumption decisions emerges nearly instantaneously in cortical ensembles.}

There is a push towards moving to open-source technologies that can: 1) be adjusted to specific experiments; 2) be shared with ease; and 3) more affordably record from larger numbers of electrodes simultaneously. Here we describe our construction of a system that satisfies these three desirable properties using the scientific Python stack and Linux. Using a Raspberry Pi to control experimental paradigms, we build a completely open-source, HDF5-based analysis (spike sorting) toolkit in Python. This toolkit can be easily parallelized and scales to incorporate increasing electrode counts and longer recordings. Our rig costs about \$5000, an order of magnitude less than many comparable commercially available electrophysiology systems.}

  abstract={The strength of learned associations between pairs of stimuli is affected by multiple factors, the most extensively studied of which is prior experience with the stimuli themselves. In contrast, little data is available regarding how experience with “incidental” stimuli (independent of any conditioning situation) impacts later learning. This lack of research is striking given the importance of incidental experience to survival. We have recently begun to fill this void using conditioned taste aversion (CTA), wherein an animal learns to avoid a taste that has been associated with malaise. We previously demonstrated that incidental exposure to salty and sour tastes (taste preexposure—TPE) enhances aversions learned later to sucrose. Here, we investigate the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. First, we use immediate early gene (c-Fos) expression to identify gustatory cortex (GC) as a site at which TPE specifically increases the neural activation caused by taste-malaise pairing (i.e., TPE did not change c-Fos induced by either stimulus in isolation). Next, we use site-specific infection with the optical silencer Archaerhodopsin-T to show that GC inactivation during TPE inhibits the expected enhancements of both learning and CTA-related c-Fos expression, a full day later. Thus, we conclude that GC is almost certainly a vital part of the circuit that integrates incidental experience into later associative learning.}
