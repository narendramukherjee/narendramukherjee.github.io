  abstract  = {In-vivo electrophysiology, the recording of neurons in the brains of awake, behaving animals, is currently undergoing paradigm shifts. There is a push towards moving to open-source technologies that can: 1) be adjusted to specific experiments; 2) be shared with ease; and 3) more affordably record from larger numbers of electrodes simultaneously. Here we describe our construction of a system that satisfies these three desirable properties using the scientific Python stack and Linux. Using a Raspberry Pi to control experimental paradigms, we build a completely open-source, HDF5-based analysis (spike sorting) toolkit in Python. This toolkit can be easily parallelized and scales to incorporate increasing electrode counts and longer recordings. Our rig costs about \$5000, an order of magnitude less than many comparable commercially available electrophysiology systems.}

  abstract = {Online reputation systems are an essential component of electronic commerce platforms. However, despite their prevalence, online ratings are subject to selection biases since the decision to leave a rating depends on the specific consumer and their circumstances. There are a number of hidden parameters governing such selection biases but it is difficult to infer them directly from observed ratings given the complexity of reputation systems. In this work, we first propose a generative model that accounts for various behavioral phenomena behind online rating generation (e.g., cost to leaving a rating or herding). We then build upon recent advances in  likelihood-free/simulation-based Bayesian inference using deep learning to infer the hidden parameters of the generative model in a scalable manner. The inference engine only takes the time series of ratings as input, and therefore can be used to model correlations of inferred cost parameters with various product features. As a preliminary proof of concept, we apply our model to a dataset of 450,000 product reviews submitted on Amazon.com. We find that the cost to leaving a negative review is much greater than a positive review, and a baseline level of bandwagon effects (in the form of herding) are present for the majority of products. Gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of reputation systems, namely, the conditions under which ratings are submitted, is crucial for marketers, brand managers, and designers of digital platforms, who can leverage this information to stimulate further reviews and better manage user generated content.}
