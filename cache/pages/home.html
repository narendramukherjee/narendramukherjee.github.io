<p>I am a graduate student working with Donald Katz in the Neuroscience program at Brandeis University. My broad research interests lie at the confluence of neuroscience, machine learning and the evolutionary basis of animal behavior. In the Katz lab, I study the neural dynamics involved in taste processing and behavior in adult rats. Taste stimuli are unique in their degree of behaviorally relevant content and guide the animal's consumption decisions. Using chronic recordings from taste cortex and amygdala and probabilistic graphical models of neural populations, I analyze the dynamic (and stochastic) responses of the taste system in the light of the animal's ingestion-egestion behavior.</p>
