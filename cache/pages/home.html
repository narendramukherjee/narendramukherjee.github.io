<p>I am a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-selects-46-international-predoctoral-fellows">Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Predoctoral Fellow</a> working with <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/katzlab/">Donald Katz</a> in the Neuroscience graduate program at <a class="reference external" href="http://sciences.brandeis.edu/index.php/graduate/neuroscience-graduate/">Brandeis University</a>. My broad research interests lie at the confluence of neuroscience, dynamical systems, machine learning and the evolutionary basis of animal behavior. In the Katz lab, I study how the processing of tastes in the brain leads to consumption or rejection decisions. For this work, I perform chronic electrophysiological recordings from large multi-electrode arrays implanted in rodents actively engaged in consumption tasks. I build probabilistic (Bayesian) graphical models to understand the neural population-level firing patterns obtained from such large-scale recordings; these statistical models, together with precisely-timed optogenetic perturbations of neural activity, have revealed a unique temporally-specific role for sensory cortex in taste-related decision making. To know more about my work with sensory cortical dynamics in the brain, please look at my <a class="reference external" href="research/current/current-research/index.html">current research</a>.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I have also been involved in developing a flexible open-source electrophysiology hardware and software system that can combine optical fibers for optogenetics with long-term recordings from over 1000 electrodes in awake rodents at a fraction of the cost of commercially-available solutions. This technological development has been the centerpiece of my efforts to expand the adoption of reproducible hardware and software in electrophysiology-based research. Much of this work has been supported by the <a class="reference external" href="http://brandeismakerlab.com/">Brandeis University Maker Lab</a> and cloud computing resources on the <a class="reference external" href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/">Jetstream</a> supercomputer of the NSF.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/vsharma/">Vijay Kumar Sharma</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/sheeba/">Sheeba Vasu</a> in the Evolutionary and Organismal Biology (EOBU) unit of the Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) in Bangalore. I studied eclosion and activity circadian rhythms in fruit flies from a dynamical systems perspective (based on Arthur Winfree's ideas).</p>
