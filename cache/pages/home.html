<p>I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist working at the <a class="reference external" href="https://careers.booking.com/locations/amsterdam/">Booking.com headquarters</a> in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I am broadly interested in Bayesian interpretations of machine learning/statistics, as well as software solutions to better productionize data and ML products. At Booking, I work primarily on ML models of multi-touch attribution and how these can have impact on marketing incrementality measurement and bidding optimization.</p>
<p>Previously, I have worked as a Research Scientist at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/innovation/research.html">Philips Research</a> in Eindhoven in the Netherlands and as a a Machine Learning Scientist at <a class="reference external" href="https://tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor</a> in Boston in the US. In these roles, I worked on a variety of ML topics ranging from recommendation systems and NLP to marketing budget optimization.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I earned my PhD working with <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/katzlab/">Prof. Donald Katz</a> in the Neuroscience graduate program at <a class="reference external" href="http://sciences.brandeis.edu/index.php/graduate/neuroscience-graduate/">Brandeis University</a> where I was also a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-selects-46-international-predoctoral-fellows">Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Predoctoral Fellow</a> . My PhD work lies at the confluence of neuroscience, dynamical systems, machine learning and the evolutionary basis of animal behavior. In the Katz lab, I studied how the processing of tastes in the brain leads to consumption or rejection decisions. For this work, I performed chronic electrophysiological recordings from large multi-electrode arrays implanted in rodents actively engaged in consumption tasks. I built probabilistic (Bayesian) graphical models to understand the neural population-level firing patterns obtained from such large-scale recordings; these statistical models, together with precisely-timed optogenetic perturbations of neural activity, have revealed a unique temporally-specific role for sensory cortex in taste-related decision making.

<p>I am deeply committed to making research and machine learning tools more accessible through open-source contributions. During my PhD, the centerpiece of these efforts was the development of a flexible open-source electrophysiology hardware and software system that can combine optical fibers for optogenetics with long-term recordings from over 1000 electrodes in awake rodents at a fraction of the cost of commercially-available solutions. Much of this work was supported by the <a class="reference external" href="http://brandeismakerlab.com/">Brandeis University Maker Lab</a> and cloud computing resources on the <a class="reference external" href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/">Jetstream</a> supercomputer of the NSF.</p>
<p>Aside from work, I am also passionate about cycling and how bicycles are key to sustainable cities of the future. Cycling has been a joy for me right from the time I grew up in India, and that hobby developed further in the years I spent cycling in the New England area in the US. However, I also started to realize how much of a center stage the automobile takes in modern cities (esp. in the US), and how that is an unsustainable, dangerous and unhealthy situation. Since moving to the Netherlands, I am learning more from the sustainable and equitable Dutch city planning expertise which puts the bicycle in a central position, and I hope to be able to write more on that in the future.
