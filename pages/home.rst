I am a `Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Predoctoral Fellow`_ working with `Donald Katz`_ in the Neuroscience graduate program at `Brandeis University`_. My broad research interests lie at the confluence of neuroscience, dynamical systems, machine learning and the evolutionary basis of animal behavior. In the Katz lab, I study how the processing of tastes in the brain leads to consumption or rejection decisions. For this work, I perform chronic electrophysiological recordings from large multi-electrode arrays implanted in rodents actively engaged in consumption tasks. I build probabilistic (Bayesian) graphical models to understand the neural population-level firing patterns obtained from such large-scale recordings; these statistical models, together with precisely-timed optogenetic perturbations of neural activity, have revealed a unique temporally-specific role for sensory cortex in taste-related decision making. To know more about my work with sensory cortical dynamics in the brain, please look at my `current research`_.

Concurrently, I have also been involved in developing a flexible open-source electrophysiology hardware and software system that can combine optical fibers for optogenetics with long-term recordings from over 1000 electrodes in awake rodents at a fraction of the cost of commercially-available solutions. This technological development has been the centerpiece of my efforts to expand the adoption of reproducible hardware and software in electrophysiology-based research. Much of this work has been supported by the `Brandeis University Maker Lab`_ and cloud computing resources on the `Jetstream`_ supercomputer of the NSF.    

Previously, I worked with `Vijay Kumar Sharma`_ and `Sheeba Vasu`_ in the Evolutionary and Organismal Biology (EOBU) unit of the Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) in Bangalore. I studied eclosion and activity circadian rhythms in fruit flies from a dynamical systems perspective (based on Arthur Winfree's ideas).
