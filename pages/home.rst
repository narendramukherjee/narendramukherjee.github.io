I am a Research Scientist working at the `Philips Research headquarters`_ in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I am broadly interested in Bayesian interpretations of machine learning/statistics, as well as software solutions to better productionize data and ML products.   

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at `Tripadvisor`_, based at their headquarters in the suburbs of Boston in the US. During my time at Tripadvisor, I worked on applying probabilistic machine learning methods to TripAdvisor's repository of large-scale structured and unstructured user-generated/business-related data. 

Prior to that, I earned my PhD working with `Prof. Donald Katz`_ in the Neuroscience graduate program at `Brandeis University`_ where I was also a `Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Predoctoral Fellow`_ . My PhD work lies at the confluence of neuroscience, dynamical systems, machine learning and the evolutionary basis of animal behavior. In the Katz lab, I studied how the processing of tastes in the brain leads to consumption or rejection decisions. For this work, I performed chronic electrophysiological recordings from large multi-electrode arrays implanted in rodents actively engaged in consumption tasks. I built probabilistic (Bayesian) graphical models to understand the neural population-level firing patterns obtained from such large-scale recordings; these statistical models, together with precisely-timed optogenetic perturbations of neural activity, have revealed a unique temporally-specific role for sensory cortex in taste-related decision making. To know more about this work, please look at my `PhD research`_.

I am deeply committed to making research and machine learning tools more accessible through open-source contributions. During my PhD, the centerpiece of these efforts was the development of a flexible open-source electrophysiology hardware and software system that can combine optical fibers for optogenetics with long-term recordings from over 1000 electrodes in awake rodents at a fraction of the cost of commercially-available solutions. Much of this work was supported by the `Brandeis University Maker Lab`_ and cloud computing resources on the `Jetstream`_ supercomputer of the NSF.   

Aside from work, I am also passionate about cycling and how bicycles are key to sustainable cities of the future. Cycling has been a joy for me right from the time I grew up in India, and that hobby developed further in the years I spent cycling in the New England area in the US. However, I also started to realize how much of a center stage the automobile takes in modern cities (esp. in the US), and how that is an unsustainable, dangerous and unhealthy situation. Since moving to the Netherlands, I am learning more from the sustainable and equitable Dutch city planning expertise which puts the bicycle in a central position, and I hope to be able to write more on that in the future. Till then, browse the `NotJustBikes`_ YouTube channel to learn about the subject.
