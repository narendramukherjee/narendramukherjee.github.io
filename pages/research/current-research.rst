Taste stimuli land on the tongue replete with both chemical (identity-related) and behavioral (palatability-related) information. Classically, cortical responses to taste stimuli (as is common in sensory systems neuroscience) have been studied from a trial-averaged, single neuron perspective. Fascinatingly, however, taste cortex neurons display highly dynamic and multi-modal responses to taste stimuli that gradually transition from reflecting stimulus identity to palatability. Taste palatability can be better understood as the critically important decision-making variable, guiding the animal to ingest the palatable ("yummy" tastes) and reject the aversive ("yucky" tastes). Using adult rodents, I study the variability inherent in the responses of taste cortex neural populations (also called "ensembles") in the context of this ingest-reject decision from a dynamical systems perspective.

"Noisy" dynamics holds behavioral significance
==============================================

Studying sensory systems from a single neuron perspective is a common tradition in neuroscience. The stimulus is typically presented to the animal multiple times and the responses of individual neurons are averaged across these repeated presentations to get a sense of each neuron's "mean representation". Response variability, both across neurons and trials, is dismissed as "noise".
