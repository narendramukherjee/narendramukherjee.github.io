It has made it possible for so many more people to attend and learn from international conferences, in a way that doesn't break the bank or the work week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://global.pydata.org/"&gt;2020 Global PyData conference&lt;/a&gt; has gone entirely online and consists of pre-recorded talks from speakers together with Q&amp;amp;A sessions that are aligned to a variety of time zones. I was fortunate to have a part of my recent work at Tripadvisor be accepted at the conference for a 30 min talk; preparing and recording an online talk was a totally new experience for me, and I think I have learnt a lot of new presentation (and environment setup) skills in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I go over the merit of thinking deeply about missing values in any real-world machine learning problem, especially those that involve tree-based models. I go on to talk about the imputation approach that we used while designing a recommendation system at Tripadvisor, and discuss how it can be thought of as a simplified Bayesian inference recipe in a probabilistic graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really excited about the talk and the feedback I am going to get during the Q&amp;amp;A session - do browse the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://narendramukherjee.github.io/pydata_global_talk/PyData_Global_2020.pdf"&gt;slides from the talk&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Bayesian</category><category>machine learning</category><category>open source</category><category>Python</category><guid>https://narendramukherjee.github.io/blog/when-features-go-missing-bayes-comes-to-the-rescue/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 20:37:28 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
