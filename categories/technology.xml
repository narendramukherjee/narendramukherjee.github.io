Both these devices are part of a line-up that Logitech is currently promoting for multi-tasking between several computers - they can each pair with 3 different computers, and can use a single &lt;em&gt;Unifying&lt;/em&gt; receiver to pair to the same computer. I don't work with several devices at once, but would definitely like to not have more than the necessary number of receivers plugged into my computer; unfortunately, Logitech's unifying software only works with Windows/Mac, so I had to do some browsing to figure out a Linux alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a nifty tool designed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Lekensteyn"&gt;Peter Wu&lt;/a&gt; to get Logitech devices to work with Linux: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Lekensteyn/ltunify"&gt;ltunify&lt;/a&gt;. I tried it on Ubuntu 18.04 and it works perfectly out of the box to pair both my devices to the same computer using a single Unifying receiver. In addition, you may want to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pwr-solaar.github.io/Solaar/"&gt;Solaar&lt;/a&gt; to get a nice system tray which displays battery levels, settings etc for each of your paired devices. You can pair upto six Logitech devices to a computer using one Unifying receiver.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Technology</category><guid>https://narendramukherjee.github.io/blog/using-the-logitech-unifying-receiver-on-linux/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:48:23 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
